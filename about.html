            <p>In the beginning, we had nothing: no stoves, no special equipment, no workers - only a strong desire to
                start making ceramics with our own hands. Everything changed when clients from the restaurant business
                found out about us.</p>

            <p>Our entire workflow is based on traditional technology. Basically, everything is done by hand, so the
                dishes are very "alive". Most often, each of the employees in production is assigned to their own area
                of work: mass kneading, casting, processing, painting and many others.</p>
            <p>But we try to help each other and change places if necessary.</p>
            <p>We are just starting to form a big strategic goal, but in general terms, we want to become a successful
                brand for the production of tableware and interior items in Russia. We believe that aesthetics affects
                the formation of the personality, and, consequently, society.</p>

            <p>Style is a very serious term. Its formation and clear cut are still ahead of us. Natural minimalism is
                close to us, so to speak. We draw inspiration from the world around us and do not seek to invent complex
                shapes or make elaborate painting.</p>
